# TweetClassifier

## Task
The project, consisting of four sub-projects, aims to develop a sentiment classifier for analyzing Twitter data related to the Greek elections. The classifier utilizes four distinct machine learning techniques to perform sentiment analysis, each providing unique advantages for handling social media data.

### Machine Learning Techniques

1. **Logistic Regression**
   - A simple linear model used to classify sentiment based on features extracted from the text.

2. **Deep Neural Networks (DNN)**
   - A multi-layered neural network designed to capture complex patterns in the data, enabling better sentiment classification.

3. **Bidirectional Stacked Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**
   - A noteworthy aspect of the RNN project is the use of an attention mechanism, which improves model performance by allowing the model to concentrate on specific parts of the input sequence.

4. **BERT Transformers**
   - For this project, pre-trained models *GreekBERT* and *DistilGREEK-BERT* are used.


## Evaluation
Each project is accompanied by a comprehensive report that thoroughly details all the experiments conducted. The evaluation of the models takes into account several key metrics, including the F1 score, loss, ROC curves, and confusion matrices, to assess their performance from different angles.
